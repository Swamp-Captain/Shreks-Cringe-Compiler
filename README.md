Ah, greetings, you ignored Shrek and stayed in the swamp! Here’s how you wield this mighty tool:

Equip the Cringe Compiler in Swamp Cinema:

Open the shop in Swamp Cinema and equip Shrek's Cringe Compiler. Without it, the magic won’t work!

Set Your Screenshot Directory:

Open Shrek’s Cringe Compiler program (this one).

Click the "Change Directory" button to tell Shrek where your Cringe Compiler camera saves screenshots.

Take Photos in Game:

Snap some glorious swamp memories in Swamp Cinema.



Shrek’s Cringe Compiler will:

Upload the screenshot to catbox.moe.

Automatically copy the link to your clipboard. Easy peasy swampy squeezy.

Optional: Remove Backgrounds (For Swamp Enthusiasts):

Check the "Remove Background" box in Shrek’s Cringe Compiler.

Screenshots will be sent to remove.bg, where AI magic attempts to remove the background.

Get an API Key for Background Removal:

Visit remove.bg and create a free account. You’ll get 50 free removals per month (or be ogre-smart and make extra accounts for more API keys).

Paste your API key into Shrek’s Cringe Compiler in the provided text box.

Watch the Magic Happen:

Transparent-background images are uploaded to Catbox. Both the original and processed images are saved, but only the transparent version’s link is copied.


*****NOTE*****
This tool was made by The Captain (https://steamcommunity.com/id/notcogs/) STEAM_0:0:163044248  using ~85% ChatGPT-assisted Python coding. Originally made for personal use, it’s now available for others to enjoy. I’m not an expert, and this was just a fun project born from boredom.

Feel free to critique or request the original .py file if you’re curious. I’ve scanned the program thoroughly and believe it poses no security threat to Swamp Servers LLC, the user’s primary machine, or any other users connected to Swamp Cinema.

Happy cringe compiling!
